# Getting Started

We want to make it easy for you to build on Biconomyâ€™s transaction infrastructure. Using Biconomy's Gasless SDK (EOA) you can customize a transaction journey that perfectly suits your use case. You can read ['Why Biconomy?'](https://docs-gasless.biconomy.io/introduction/why-biconomy) to understand the problems we are solving.

We use meta transactions to simplify the transactional layer on blockchain and crypto networks. [Learn how.](https://docs-gasless.biconomy.io/introduction/how-we-simplify-transactions)

- The first step is to make your contract meta transaction compliant. In order to do this, you can follow the [EIP2771 standard](https://docs-gasless.biconomy.io/products/enable-gasless-transactions/choose-an-approach-to-enable-gasless/eip-2771) or implement in a [custom](https://docs-gasless.biconomy.io/products/enable-gasless-transactions/choose-an-approach-to-enable-gasless/custom-implementation) fashion. [Help me choose!](https://docs.biconomy.io/products/enable-gasless-transactions#choosing-an-approach)
- The next step is to [register your dApp](https://docs-gasless.biconomy.io/guides/biconomy-dashboard) on our dashboard, add smart contracts and manage the right methods. Later, you can also view your dApp statistics on the dashboard.
- Finally, integrate our [Gasless SDK (EOA)](https://docs-gasless.biconomy.io/sdk/biconomy-sdk-mexa) in your dApp code using the API Key you get from the dashboard.
  
To start sending gasless transactions, read our guide on [enabling gasless transactions.](https://docs-gasless.biconomy.io/products/enable-gasless-transactions)

To enable instant cross-chain transfers on your dApp read our guide on [Hyphen.](https://docs-gasless.biconomy.io/)

To allow your users to send transactions without changing RPC, read our guide on [network agnostic transactions.](https://docs-gasless.biconomy.io/products/enable-gasless-transactions/choose-an-approach-to-enable-gasless/network-agnostic-transactions)

You can also get more inspiration and ideas by checking out our tutorials. Learn to [build your first dApp.](https://docs-gasless.biconomy.io/tutorials/native-meta-transactions/how-to-build-your-first-dapp) The FAQ has some frequent questions by developers in your position. Feel free to [connect with us](https://t.me/biconomy) if you have any questions.
