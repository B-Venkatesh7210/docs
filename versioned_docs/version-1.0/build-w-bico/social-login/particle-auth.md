# Using Particle Auth

## What is Particle Authï¼Ÿ

Particle Auth is a simple self-custodial auth infra for Web3 apps and wallets. We support mobile number and email login, providing users with a simple operating experience. Their login account is then associated with a blockchain wallet, which is secured with a "Threshold Signatures vault".

## Why Particle Auth?

Particle Auth is committed to helping Web2 users enter the Web3 world easily with their most familiar login methods.

Users can log in to your dApp through **Google, Apple ID, Facebook, Twitter, and other social methods**, and can also log in with an **Email / Mobile number** without a password.

After the user successfully logs in, Particle Auth will automatically create a crypto wallet without a private key. The security is guaranteed by **MPC (Multi-Party Computing) - based threshold signatures,** which is ahead of other technologies.
