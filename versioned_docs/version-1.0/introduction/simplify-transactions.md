# How we simplify transactions?

> Enable a simple blockchain transaction experience by leveraging our scalable relayer infrastructure.

By understanding the pain points for both developers and their end-users, crypto savvy or otherwise, our aim is to simplify transactions by handling blockchain-related complexities under the hood.

Through Biconomy's infrastructure, your users can:

- Onboard without paying gas through gasless transactions.
- Avoid blockchain complexities such as changing network.
- Enjoy lightning-fast confirmed transactions.

Moreover, our infrastructure takes care of **gas optimization** and **transaction management.** We deal with gas price fluctuations to reduce gas costs by as much as 40% so that you can focus on building your project. We also make sure that your transactions are never pending or stuck for long.

## How do we do it?

This is possible using the concept of **meta transactions** where the user is able to do a transaction on the blockchain with zero balance account and any third party can pay for the transaction fees for the user. We **enable this at scale by providing a non-custodial and gas-efficient relayer infrastructure network.**
