# Common Contracts

Smart contracts that extend Smart Account functionality

**_Module Manager_**

(https://github.com/bcnmy/scw-contracts/blob/master/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/base/ModuleManager.sol)

Module Manager allows to enable and disable modules.
Module Manager is also in charge of executing transactions coming from Modules on behalf of the Smart Account.

#### What are modules?

Modules add additional functionalities to the Smart Accounts. They are smart contracts that implement the Smart Accountâ€™s functionality while separating module logic from the core contract. Depending on the use case, modules could for instance allow the execution of transactions without requiring a signature confirmation.

Modules can allow for Multisig access control, alternative signing schemes, such as passkeys, Social recovery, etc.

**_FallbackManager_**

(https://github.com/bcnmy/scw-contracts/blob/master/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/base/FallbackManager.sol)

A contract that manages fallback calls made to the Smart Account

Fallback calls are handled by a `handler` contract that is stored at `FALLBACK_HANDLER_STORAGE_SLOT.`

Fallback calls are not delegated to the `handler` so they can not directly change Smart Account storage.
