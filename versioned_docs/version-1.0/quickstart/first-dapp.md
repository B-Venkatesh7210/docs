# Build your first AA powered dApp

This tutorial will cover the basics of creating a dApp powered by the Biconomy
SDK. Here's an overview of what you'll learn:

-   Build a basic smart contract that will act as a counter.
-   Deploy the smart contract with Remix.
-   Register the contract and its write methods on the Biconomy Dashboard.
-   Create a frontend with React and Vite that allows for social logins and
    gasless transactions with the Biconomy SDK.
