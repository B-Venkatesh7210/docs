# Get Fee Quotes or Data Endpoint

The Paymaster Service will introduce two new endpoints for Token and Sponsorship paymasters. Both endpoints must follow the [JSON RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) specifications.

:::info
You can get your paymasterUrl from Biconomy Dashboard after registering the paymaster. The Paymaster will look like this
https://paymaster.biconomy.io/api/v1/{chainId}/[YOUR_API_KEY_HERE]

 The endpoint URL will same as paymasterURL for both `pm_getFeeQuotesOrData` and `pm_sponsorUserOperation`.

:::

-------

## 1. Get Fee Quotes or Data Endpoint

**`pm_getFeeQuotesOrData`** This endpoint can be used to retrieve the **MODE**. This approach is to be used if you would like to use the Token Paymaster. The following cases are currently supported:

:::note

**"MODE"** is optional for `pm_getFeeQuotesOrData`

- If **"MODE"** in request is not defined, we initially check for sponsorship and return `paymaster&Data` (Sponsorship paymaster data) but if request cannot be sponsored, we return `FeeQuotes` (i.e. token paymaster data)

- If **"MODE"** is **SPONSORED** , we check for request sponsorship. If request cannot be sponsored, we return the data as 0x. This would mean that user will have to pay for the gas fees. 

- If **"MODE"** is **ERC20** , we return Feequote for TokenPaymaster.
:::


#### 1. Mode is **SPONSORED**: 

> ***POST Request***

```javascript

{
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
	"method": "pm_getFeeQuoteOrData",
	"id": 1,
	"params": [
		{
			...partialUserOp
		},
		{
			"mode": "SPONSORED",
      
      // Mandatory Fields
			"sponsorshipInfo": {
				"webhookData": {},
				"smartAccountInfo": {
					"name": "BICONOMY" | "INFINITSM",
					"version": "1.0.0"
				}
			}
		}
	]
}
```


In this case, since the mode is sponsored, `sponsorshipInfo` is required to decode the call data and check the limits set on the dashboard by the developer.

	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
	"id": 1,
	"result": {

	}
}
```

#### 2. Mode is **ERC20**:

> ***POST Request***

```javascript
{
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
	"method": "pm_getFeeQuoteOrData",
	"id": 1,
	"params": [
		{
			..userOpParams
		},
		{
			"mode": "ERC20",
      // Mandatory Fields
			"tokenInfo": {
				"preferredToken": "0xbf22b04e250a5921ab4dc0d4ced6e391459e92d4",

				]
			}
		}
	]
}
```

<details>
  <summary> Check for params here: </summary>

`paymasterAddress` *

Address of paymaster that is going to be used for given `UserOp`. In case of ERC20 mode, client should give approval to this address from user account.

`mode` *Optional*

This is the mode which is going to be used for given `UserOp`. This is only applicable for Hybrid Paymaster.

If value is **ERC20**, token paymaster flow will be used. In this case only `feeQuotes` are available in the response and `paymasterAndData` will not be present. Here, client can then show the list of tokens for user to choose the gas token or use the default token from response.

If value is **SPONSORED** , sponsorship paymaster flow will be used. Here paymasterAndData will be returned in the response and not the feeQuotes.

`paymasterAndData`  *Optional*

This field contains the `paymasterAndData` to be used in `UserOp` before signing on client side. This field is only returned if SponsorshipPaymaster can be used in the flow and mode value is **SPONSORED**.

`feeQuotes` *Optional*

This will be present in the response if mode is **ERC20**, it contains array of token objects that are applicable for gas payments for the given `UserOp`. This array is sorted by markup percentage.

**Fee Quotes Object Param explained**


| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| symbol | Token symbol |

:::info
If the paymaster mode is **ERC20** then it is recommended to include the `tokenInfo` field in order to avoid latency.

- If `preferredToken` is included, fee quotes will return a response only for this token.

- If `preferredToken` is blank, `tokenList` will be considered and feeQoute for all mentioned tokens in the array will be returned.

- If Both `preferredToken` & `tokenList` are empty, `feeQuote` for all the supported token by Biconomy will be returned in the response.
:::




:::note
If both `preferredToken` & `tokenList` are present in the request body, but some tokens are not supported by Biconomy, those will be returned also in the response body under `unsupportedTokens`.
:::


#### 3. Mode is **EMPTY** :

In this case, the API should check for both SponsorshipPaymaster and Token Paymaster conditions. If the `mode` parameter is not available in the request, it will start checking the SponsorshipPaymaster conditions. If these conditions are met, it will return the response with `paymasterAndData` but without the `feeQuotes`. The `mode` value here must be `SPONSORED`.

If the Sponsorship Paymaster conditions fail, then it will check for Token Paymaster conditions as described in the TokenPaymaster section, and return the response accordingly. In this case feeQuotes is returned but not the paymasterAndData.

However, if the `mode` value is available in the request and is equal to `ERC20`, then checks for Sponsorship Paymaster should be skipped, and only the Token Paymaster flow should be followed.

Based on the `mode` value in the response, the client will decide whether to show gas payment options to the user or not.
