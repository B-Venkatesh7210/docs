# Smart Account Modules

The new Smart Account package provides a basic smart account contract whose functionalities & capabilities can be easily & securely extended as per their desired user journey. This is enabled by our modular architecture. Devs can plug-in programmable modules to enable specific use cases.

Currently, we have these modules live:
 
ECDSA Module: Regular EOA signature
Passkey Module: Onboard with Face ID or biometrics
Session Keys Module: Remove neccesity for signature within a defined session
Multi-chain Validation Module: One signature to delegate actions on multiple chains
Account Recovery Module: Ability to recover accounts if compromised

In the future, the list will continously grow. We are also releasing a framework to enable the community to build more modules.
