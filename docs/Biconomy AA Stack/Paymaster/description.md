# Description

Biconomy offers a Paymaster service designed with one of the best developer experiences in mind. Simply use one URL and switch modes between our sponsorship paymaster and our Token Paymaster. 

## Sponsorship Paymaster

![Sponsored](../../images/overview/sponsored.png)

If the mode you choose in the request to the Paymaster URL is the sponsored mode, your users will benefit from gasless transactions, and you remove the friction point of needed native tokens to pay for gas on transactions. Learn how to set up your paymaster [here](/docs/dashboard/paymaster).

## Token Paymaster

![Erc20](../../images/overview/erc20gas.png)

Switching the mode of your Paymster to ERC20 allows you to unlock an experience where users can pay gas in any of our supported ERC20 tokens on different networks. Check out the latest supported tokens [here](/docs/supportedchains/supportedTokens).

Learn how to utilize either of these Paymasters by checking out our How To Guide on [Executing transactions](/docs/category/executing-transactions)
