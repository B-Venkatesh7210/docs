# API References

## Biconomy Paymaster Service


1. The Biconomy paymaster will enable a single paymaster URL generation on our dashboard, which can be used for gas sponsorship as well as enabling users to pay gas in ERC20 tokens.
2. Instead of keeping multiple paymaster URLs to differentiate the paymaster type, the API request body now includes a **MODE** parameter.
3. The **MODE** will be sent to indicate whether the dApp wants sponsored transactions for its users or wants to enable ERC20 payments by users.


### Paymaster Service APIs

The Paymaster Service will introduce two new endpoints for both paymasters mentioned above. Both endpoints must follow the [JSON RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) specifications.

1. Get feeQuotes or Data Endpoint (applicable to Biconomy Hybrid Paymaster use case only)
2. Sponsor UserOp Endpoint

:::info
To find base URL, use the following :

https://paymaster.biconomy.io/api/v1/chainId/apiKey

 `ChainId` will be the chain your dApp is on and `apiKey` from [Biconomy Dashboard](https://dashboard-gasless.biconomy.io)

:::



### 1. Get Fee Quotes or Data Endpoint

**`pm_getFeeQuotesOrData`** This endpoint can be used to retrieve the **MODE**. The following cases are currently supported:

#### 1. Mode is **SPONSORED**: 

> ***POST Request***

```javascript

{
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
	"method": "pm_getFeeQuoteOrData",
	"id": 1,
	"params": [
		{
			..userOpParams
		},
		{
			"mode": "SPONSORED",
      
      // Mandatory Fields
			"sponsorshipInfo": {
				"webhookData": {},
				"smartAccountInfo": {
					"name": "BICONOMY" | "INFINITSM",
					"version": "1.0.0"
				}
			}
		}
	]
}
```


In this case, since the mode is sponsored, `sponsorshipInfo` is required to decode the call data and check the limits set on the dashboard by the developer.

> ***Response***

 
```javascript
{
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
	"id": 1,
	"result": {
		"MODE": "SPONSORED",
		"paymasterAndData": "0xdc91ffb7c4b800d70410a79a5b503ae4391f67e40000000000000000000000007306ac7a32eb690232de81a9ffb44bb346026fab00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000041e1f74852c31150f18ef4e472b748148f8ae031849032218b26170414a18c9f99516eb13a4a9bd35d1334194348cccee3d270b6e7bb400b39f0c8d645266ead601c00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
	}
}
```

#### 2. Mode is **ERC20**:

> ***POST Request***

```javascript
{
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
	"method": "pm_getFeeQuoteOrData",
	"id": 1,
	"params": [
		{
			..userOpParams
		},
		{
			"mode": "ERC20",
      // Optional Fields
			"tokenInfo": {
				"preferredToken": "0xbf22b04e250a5921ab4dc0d4ced6e391459e92d4",
				"tokenList": [
					"0xdA5289FCAAF71d52A80A254dA614A192B693e975",
					"0xda5289fcaaf71d52a80a254da614a192b693e977",
					"0xeabc4b91d9375796aa4f69cc764a4ab509080a58"
				]
			}
		}
	]
}
```


:::info
If the mode is **ERC20**, `TokenInfo` is recommended in order to avoid latency.

If `preferredToken` is sent, fee Quote will be sent for the same only.

If `preferredToken` is blank, `tokenList` will be considered and feeQoute for all mentioned tokens in the array will be returned.

If Both `preferredToken` & `tokenList` are empty, `feeQuote` for all the supported token by Biconomy will be returned in the response.

	}
}
```


<details>
  <summary> params explained here : </summary>

`paymasterAddress` *

Address of paymaster that is going to be used for given `UserOp`. In case of ERC20 mode, client should give approval to this address from user account.

`mode` *Optional*

This is the mode which is going to be used for given `UserOp`. This is only applicable for Hybrid Paymaster.

If value is **ERC20**, token paymaster flow will be used. In this case only `feeQuotes` are available in the response and `paymasterAndData` will not be present. Here, client can then show the list of tokens for user to choose the gas token or use the default token from response.

If value is **SPONSOR** , verifying paymaster flow will be used. Here paymasterAndData will be returned in the response and not the feeQuotes.

`paymasterAndData`  *Optional*

This field contains the `paymasterAndData` to be used in `UserOp` before signing on client side. This field is only returned if VerifyingPaymaster can be used in the flow and mode value is **SPONSOR**.

`feeQuotes` *Optional*

This will be present in the response if mode is **ERC20**, it contains array of token objects that are applicable for gas payments for the given `UserOp`. This array is sorted by markup percentage.

**Fee Quotes Object Param explained**


| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| symbol | Token symbol |
| decimal | Token decimal |
| address | Token address |
| maxGasFee | Max amount of gas fee in token units that can be charged from the user account. This includes markup fee and additional cost of token approval. |
| logoUrl | Token logo URL |
| exchangePrice | Exchange price of token. No of tokens in 1 unit of native currency. |
| markupPercentage | Markup percentage thatâ€™ll be charged for given token on top of gas fee. |


</details>


:::note
If both `preferredToken` & `tokenList` are present in the request body, but some tokens are not supported by Biconomy, those will be returned also in the response body under `unsupportedTokens`.
:::


#### 3. Mode is **EMPTY** :

In this case, the API should check for both Verifying Paymaster and Token Paymaster conditions. If the `mode` parameter is not available in the request, it will start checking the Verifying Paymaster conditions. If these conditions are met, it will return the response with `paymasterAndData` but without the `feeQuotes`. The `mode` value here must be `SPONSORED`.

If the Verifying Paymaster conditions fail, then it will check for Token Paymaster conditions as described in the TokenPaymaster section, and return the response accordingly. In this case feeQuotes is returned but not the paymasterAndData.

However, if the `mode` value is available in the request and is equal to `ERC20`, then checks for Verifying Paymaster should be skipped, and only the Token Paymaster flow should be followed.

Based on the `mode` value in the response, the client will decide whether to show gas payment options to the user or not.

> ***POST Request***

```javascript
{
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
	"method": "pm_getFeeQuotesOrData",
	"id": "1",
	"params" : {
		{
		// Partial UserOp object
		},                        
		{
			"tokenInfo": {
				"preferredToken": "0xbf22b04e250a5921ab4dc0d4ced6e391459e92d3",

				"smartAccountInfo": {
					"name": "BICONOMY",
					"version": "1.0.0"
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

> ***Response***

- **Success Response** :

Either one of the two above mentioned cases, whichever is successful.

- **Error Response**

```javascript

{
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
	"id": "1",
	"error": {
		"code": ERROR_CODE,
		"message": "error message"
	}
}
```

### 2. Sponsor UserOP End Point

**`pm_sponsorUserOperation`** : 

This API is responsible for calculating the `paymasterAndData` field, if applicable, for the given request.

The API receives a partial `UserOp` and an optional token address. From the mode parameter in request, it checks for the type of paymaster this request is for, and processes the request accordingly, as outlined below.

**Sponsorship Paymaster**

To determine whether a request can be sponsored by the Sponsorship Paymaster, only consider the partial UserOp object and the sponsorshipInfo. If the request cannot be sponsored, return "0x" as the `paymasterAndData`.

**Token Paymaster**

Consider both the partial `UserOp` and tokenAddress parameters in this case. If the token address is absent, an error will be thrown. If both are present, check for the TokenPaymaster flow and send the `paymasterAndData` response accordingly. If the token address is not supported, an error will also be thrown. Please see the error response at the end of this document.

#### 1. Mode is **ERC20** :

> ***POST Request***

```javascript
{
	"id": 1,
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
