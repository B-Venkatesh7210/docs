# ECDSA Ownership Module

This is a basic module that determines "ownership" of the smart account. Smart Accounts are not able to initiate their own transactions on chain and so an Externally Owned Account is needed to sign transactions before they can be sent on chain. The ECDSA ownership module allows us to use a traditional EOA to achieve this.

## Integration
There is no need to create a module instance if the desired module to use is ECDSA Ownership Module, the Biconomy SDK will set that by default.
