# Integration

This guide soley focuses on the code to integrate the Paymaster package. To see how this interacts with other packages in the sdk you can view the [Smart Accounts Integration page](/Account/integration). 

## Installation

First, install the required packages for initializing the Paymaster. 

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="js" label="npm">

```bash

npm install @biconomy/paymaster

```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="py" label="yarn">

```bash

yarn add @biconomy/paymaster

```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="pnpm">

```bash

pnpm add @biconomy/paymaster

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Integration Example

```typescript

import { IPaymaster, BiconomyPaymaster } from '@biconomy/paymaster'

  // create instance of paymaster
  const paymaster: IPaymaster = new BiconomyPaymaster({
    //https://dashboard.biconomy.io/ get paymaster urls from your dashboard
    paymasterUrl: ""
  })


```

Once initialized you will be able to pass this paymaster instance to the Smart Account configuration to use in conjunction with our Smart Accounts. See our [tutorials](/category/tutorials) for in depth integrations of the Smart Account and Paymaster.
