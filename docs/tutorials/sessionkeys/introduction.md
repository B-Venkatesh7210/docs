# Introduction to Session Keys in dApps üåê

This guide focuses on **session keys** in decentralized applications (dApps), highlighting their role in enhancing user experience and security.

:::note
**Session Keys**: Session keys are **temporary cryptographic keys** used in dApps for validating transactions or operations without the need for constant user interaction, maintaining both security and ease of use. They're like one-time passwords but for blockchain transactions.
:::

## Why Session Keys?

Traditionally, blockchain operations require **explicit user approval** for each transaction, typically through a **digital signature**. While secure, this can be cumbersome, particularly for frequent transactions. Session keys offer a **seamless and user-friendly alternative**.

:::tip
**User-Friendly Transactions**: Utilizing session keys allows dApps to process multiple transactions with **single user approval**, greatly enhancing the user experience.
:::

## How Do Session Keys Work?

Session keys are **temporary** and have **defined permissions**. Once a user approves a session, the dApp can autonomously execute transactions within the session's limits, eliminating the need for further approvals.

:::info
**Scope and Permissions**: The scope of a session key, like the **types, duration and volume of transactions** it can authorize, is predefined. This ensures a balance between **control and convenience**.
:::

## Use Cases of Session Keys

- **Token Transfers**: Automating small, recurrent token transfers without requiring the user to confirm each one.
- **Voting in DAOs**: Facilitating users to participate in multiple votes in a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) without repeated confirmations.

:::warning
**Security Reminder**: Despite their convenience, session keys must be handled with care. It's crucial to **strictly define their scope** to mitigate potential security risks.
