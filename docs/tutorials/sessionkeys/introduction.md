# Introduction

This tutorial will cover how to use session keys in a dApp. In this tutorial we will: 

- Go over a smart contract that allows for sessions to be validated for ERC20 token transfers.
- Go over initilization and creation of a session key on a Next JS frontend. (note that the steps for this will be the same as any React frontend) 
- Execute a basic ERC20 token transfer without the need to sign
