# Introduction

The Biconomy Smart Accounts can be created in many different ways. Your use case may be centered around web3 natives who want to use their EOA's to create smart accounts, or you may be catering towards non web3 natives who need a familiar social login. Either way we have you covered in creating smart accounts. 

Our Smart Account solution is compatible with any social provider that allows you to access the signer of the EOA that is created by the solution. Although we have packages available for you to build with we are also flexible in working with solutions you may have already built in to your dApp. Let's explore different ways you can create Smart Accounts with Biconomy.

The following are code snippets that can be copy pasted into different frontend framewoks for creating smart accounts.
